                For anyone who doesn&apos;t know me â€“ I&apos;m a business
                student. When I came to Queen&apos;s, I wanted to make a ton of
                money and thought I could do it through finance or consulting.
                However, I quickly realized that despite how much I love money
                (trust me, I LOVE money), I don&apos;t love it enough where I
                could work an unfulfilling career. No diss, to anyone pursuing
                finance or consulting â€“ I just realized they&apos;re not for me.

                hackathon that ignited my passion for building software.

                Ever since, I&apos;ve been determined to break into tech and
                have done pretty well this past year. I&apos;ve worked as a
                software engineer at two early stage companies, sold my AI
                startup, and just landed an internship offer from Shopify. But
                here&apos;s a secret:

            <Spacer />
            <ImportantBlock text="I still don't know shit about tech." />
            <Spacer />
            <P>
                I&apos;m all about taking action first and figuring it out along
                the way, but the downside to this approach has been I&apos;ve
                prioritized landing jobs over mastering fundamental concepts.
                For example:
            </P>
            <Spacer />
            <List>
                <ListItem>.map vs .forEach in JavaScript</ListItem>
                <ListItem>What&apos;s the purpose of arrow functions?</ListItem>
                <ListItem>
                    What exactly is Model-View-Controller (MVC)?
                </ListItem>
                <ListItem>
                    What does it mean when a component &quot;mounts&quot;?
                </ListItem>
                <ListItem>Why do we use useEffect for fetching data?</ListItem>
                <ListItem>
                    Why must React hooks be used at the top level of components?
                </ListItem>
                <ListItem>What even is a hook? ðŸ’€</ListItem>
            </List>
            <Spacer />

                Embarrassing, I know. But after securing my internship at
                Shopify, I find myself in a unique &quot;limbo&quot; period for
                onceâ€“I&apos;m not scrambling to find another job. This summer,
                I&apos;m using this breathing room to master the basics of
                full-stack development.

                This is a living article that I&apos;ll use to document my
                journey to becoming a 10x engineer: what resources I use,
                what&apos;s effective, and what I learned.
