                For anyone who doesn’t know me – I’m a business student. When I
                came to Queen’s, I wanted to make a shit ton of money and
                thought I could do it through finance or consulting. However, I
                quickly realized that despite how much I love money (trust me, I
                LOVE money), I don’t love it enough where I could work an
                unfulfilling career. No diss, to anyone pursuing finance or
                consulting – I just realized they're not for me.
